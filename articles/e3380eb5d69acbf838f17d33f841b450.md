Modern web browsers are for their majorities reliable and offer us by default a wide choice of options and features. But you may not know that it is possible to install extensions that will allow you to do much more than just browse the web.

The extension libraries associated with Chrome and Firefox browsers are impressive by the number of extensions available and the different functionalities they offer. They will allow you to do with your browser everything you want as long as what you are looking to do is something possible. For the hackers but also for the researchers and specialists of cybersecurity, these libraries of extensions are true mines of gold.

###### WHAT YOU WILL NEED

To follow this tutorial, you will need Chrome or Mozilla Firefox on your computer. Whichever browser you use, make sure it's up to date, then go to the [Google Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/) for Google Chrome users or the Firefox [add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/) page for Firefox users.

###### 1.  HTTP HEADER LIVE

"HTTP Header Live" is an extension available for Chrome and Firefox browsers used to display header information for a website. This HTTP header information is very useful for analyzing a website, that can help you to find out which charset the website uses, the language, the caching, the authorization, the expiration of the content but also informations about cookies or third-party websites that relay incoming or outgoing information from or to the website where you are.

All these data are not visible by default. "HTTP Header Live" allows you to capture easily and intuitively all queries and information transmitted by your browser in the headers of the pages. This extension also allows you to modify the requests you are capturing and then have them re-executed by your browser. This tool is often used by system administrators, web developers, and cybersecurity professionals.

###### 2. USER-AGENT SWITCHER

To view a web page, your browser sends different information about the type of device that is requesting to return the content adapted to the device you are using. For example, most modern websites do not return the same version of a website based on whether you visit it from a computer, tablet, or phone.

Unfortunately, your browser can also send a lot of personal information about your machine, your operating system or even the geographical origin of the request.

To avoid this "User-Agent Switcher" allows you to quickly and easily change the "User-Agent" of your browser offering a choice of 26 different strings and giving you also the possibility to insert a customized one.

The user interface is simple and provides immediate access to the different options available. Once you have selected a new agent, you will have to reload your page for it to be taken into account.

###### 6. PRIVACY BADGER

Browsers can leak a lot of data and personal information, and that's exactly what companies want to gain and obtain from the Internet. "Privacy Badger" has been designed to be able to automatically block invisible trackers by analyzing the domains that seem to follow you while browsing the Web.

The photos contain are a real gold mine in terms of information. You may not know it, but they contain metadata that may reveal information such as where the photo was taken, the type and brand of device used, the date and time, the program used for editing and much more.

###### 10. X-FORWARDED-FOR HEADER

Without a doubt this extension is one of my favorites. If you want to be completely anonymous while you are browsing the web, this extension is not going to be what you are looking for but it allow you anyway to do some great things. This extension allows you to quickly update the X-Forwarded-For HTTP header for various testing purposes.

Browser extension for Chrome and Firefox that opens a list of URLs and additionally extracts URLs from text. This extension allow you to open a list of URLs simultaneously, load and render page on tab focus, extract URLs from text, input text and options saved locally and open tabs in random order.

This extension requires the "Tabs" permission in order to open new tabs. The permission appears as "Access your browsing activity" because URLs of tabs are accessible, although this access is only used to set the URL of tabs opened by the extension.
