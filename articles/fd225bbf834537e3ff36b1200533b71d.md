Enumeration belongs to the first phase of Ethical Hacking. This is a process where the attacker establishes an active connection with the victim and tries to discover as many attack vectors as possible, which can be used to exploit the systems further.

**Enumeration can be used to gain information on:**

- Network shares
- SNMP data, if they are not secured properly
- IP Tables
- Usernames of different systems
- Passwords policies lists

**Enumerations depend on the services that the systems offer:**

- DNS
- NTP
- SNMP
- Linux/Windows
- SMB

Let us now discuss some of the tools that are widely used for Enumeration

###### NTP SUITE

NTP Suite is used for NTP enumeration. This is important because in a network environment, you can find other primary servers that help the hosts to update their times and you can do it without authenticating the system.

Take a look at the following example.

```bash
ntpdate 192.168.1.100

01 Sept 12:50:49 ntpdate[627]: adjust time server 192.168.1.100 offset - 0.005030 sec
```

or

```bash
# ntpdc [-ilnps] [-c command] [hostname/IP_address]
ntpdc -c sysinfo 192.168.1.100
***Warning changing to older implementation

###### ENUM4LINUX

Enum4linux is a tool for enumerating information from **Windows** and **Samba** systems. It attempts to offer similar functionality to **enum.exe** formerly available from [https://www.bindview.com](www.bindview.com). Enum4Linux is written in **Perl** and is basically a wrapper around the Samba tools **smbclient**, **rpclient**, **net** and **nmblookup**. If you don't have **Enum4Linux** yet installed on your machine, you can do it using the following commands.

```bash
sudo git clone https://github.com/portcullislabs/enum4linux
cd enum4linux && sudo chmod +x enum4linux.pl
```

Once you are ready, you can simply run the tool on your own internal IP to see all the information that a simple scan can retrieve. If you are not sure about your local IP, you can execute "`ifconfig`" in order to find it. In the below example the local IP address is referenced as "192.168.1.102".

```bash
./enum4linux.pl -U -o 192.168.1.102
```

###### SMTP-USER-ENUM

The tool smtp-user-enum is also written in **Perl** and is used to enumerate OS-level user accounts via the **SMTP** service. Enumeration is performed by inspecting the responses to **VRFY**, **EXPN** and **RCPT TO** commands. If you don't have **smtp-user-enum** yet installed on your machine, you can do it using the following commands.

```bash
sudo git clone https://github.com/pentestmonkey/smtp-user-enum
cd smtp-user-enum && sudo chmod +x smtp-user-enum.pl
```

When you already installed the tool, you can have a look on how it work by trying it on your local machine with the user **root**.

```bash
./enum4linux.pl -U -o 192.168.1.102
```

###### QUICK FIX

It is recommended to disable all services that you donâ€™t use. It reduces the possibilities of OS enumeration of the services that your systems are running.
