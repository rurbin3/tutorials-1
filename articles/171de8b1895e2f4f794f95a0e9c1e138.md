How to hide your IP? **Tor** is one of the best freely available network to protect your identity. It's considered safe because of its highly **cryptographic** data transfer methods. We are not going to explain the working of TOR in detail. If you are interested we highly suggest you read the following article on [how to change Tor Exit Node manually](https://www.askthehackers.com/how-to-change-tor-exit-node-manually/).

###### TORPHANTOM MAIN FEATURES

**Routes all Traffic**

**TorPhantom** can route all the network traffic through the TOR network and hide your IP. Every single application that tries to connect the Internet will go through the TOR network. No single ping will be leaked out, thus protecting your identity. Normally most of us use **Proxychain** or a similar application to route the traffic for a specific application.

The problem is some application tends to ignore proxy for much faster connection which can leak out sensitive information thus revealing your original identity or location. TorPhantom can prevent you from this worst scenario. TorPhantom set up certain rules in iptables to route all outgoing connections through a certain proxy port. It also rejects some sensitive incoming and outgoing request which may leak your original IP address.

**DNS Leak Protection**

Furthermore, DNS leak one of the serious issue in network security that most of us donâ€™t know. Government organizations hunt down most of the hackers using this vulnerability. No matter how safe you encrypt DNS leak is a serious issue.

Torphantom has a solution for that too. It can use a remote and anonymous DNS server to resolve a hostname, unlike other unsafe applications that use DNS provided by your ISP.

###### DOWNLOAD AND INSTALL TORPHANTOM

Open the terminal and follow the commands.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/3ndG4me/torphantom
cd torphantom
```

**Notice:**

The current Mac OS version does not route ALL traffic through TOR. The current configuration only routes MOST traffic through TOR via socks5 proxy. Any applications not configured to use this proxy such as a **_curl_** call with no proxy flags, will not go through TOR.

There is currently no way to fix this, as an equivalent to **iptables** no longer exists on Mac OS. Be sure any applications you are using while running TorPhantom are configured to use your proxy settings by default.

**LINUX:**

**Debian/Ubuntu:**

```bash
cd Linux
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

**Arch:**

```bash
cd Linux
chmod +x install-pac.sh
./install-pac.sh
```

**RHEL/CentOS/Fedora:**

```bash
cd Linux
chmod +x install-rpm.sh
./install-rpm.sh
```

**MAC OS:**

**Install Mac Ports**

```bash
cd macOS
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

###### INITIALIZE TOR SESSION

First of all, you will need to find out what is the label of your network adapter. To do so, simply invoke the below command in your terminal.

```bash
ifconfig
```

**Output**

In our case and for this demo, the label used by our network adapter is referred to "**wlp2s0**".

**Start Torphantom**

```bash
sudo torphantom start -i wlp2s0
```
