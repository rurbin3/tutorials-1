## Top 20 Most used Hacking and Pentesting Tools

> Hacking Tools are computer programs and scripts that help hackers and security researchers find and exploit weaknesses in computer systems, web applications, servers, and networks. There is a variety of such tools available on the market.

Some of them are open source while others are the commercial solution. Some are dedicated to Windows users meanwhile another is only made for Linux lovers. In this article, we will discuss in brief the top 20 tools that are widely used to prevent hacking and getting unauthorized access to a computer or network system.

###### 1. NMAP

![image-1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neoslab/tutorials/master/medias/3f50658f30aaa5da86dae9acdaf0e4b6-1.png "Image-1")

[Nmap](https://nmap.org/) stands for Network Mapper. It is an open-source tool that is used widely for network discovery and security auditing. Nmap was originally designed to scan large networks, but it can work equally well for single hosts. Network administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or service uptime.

**Nmap uses raw IP packets to determine**

- What hosts are available on the network.
- What services those hosts are offering.
- What operating systems they are running on.
- What type of firewalls are in use and other such characteristics.

Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems such as Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux.

![image-11](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neoslab/tutorials/master/medias/3f50658f30aaa5da86dae9acdaf0e4b6-11.png "Image-11")

[Tor Browser](https://www.torproject.org/download/) is free and open-source software for enabling anonymous communication. The name is derived from an acronym for the original software project name "The Onion Router". **Tor** directs Internet traffic through a free, worldwide, volunteer overlay network consisting of more than seven thousand relays to conceal a user's location and usage from anyone conducting network surveillance or traffic analysis.

- Tor Browser isolates each website you visit so third-party trackers and ads can't follow you. Any cookies automatically clear when you're done browsing. So will your browsing history.
- Tor Browser prevents someone from watching your connection from knowing what websites you visit. All anyone monitoring your browsing habits can see is that you're using Tor.
- Tor Browser aims to make all users look the same making it difficult for you to be fingerprinted based on your browser and device information.

Using [Tor Browser](https://www.torproject.org/download/) makes it more difficult to trace Internet activity to the user. This includes "visits to Web sites, online posts, instant messages, and other communication forms". Tor's intended use is to protect the personal privacy of its users, as well as their freedom and ability to conduct confidential communication by keeping their Internet activities unmonitored.

[Snort](https://www.snort.org) is a free open source network intrusion detection system (IDS) and intrusion prevention system (IPS) created in 1998 by Martin Roesch, founder and former CTO of Sourcefire. Snort is now developed by Cisco.

Snort's open source network-based intrusion detection/prevention system (IDS/IPS) can perform real-time traffic analysis and packet logging on Internet Protocol (IP) networks. Snort performs protocol analysis, content searching, and matching.

The program can also be used to detect probes or attacks, including, but not limited to, operating system fingerprinting attempts, semantic URL attacks, buffer overflows, server message block probes, and stealth port scans.

**Snort can be configured in three main modes**

- Sniffer.
- Packet logger.
- Network intrusion detection.

In sniffer mode, the program will read network packets and display them on the console. In packet logger mode, the program will log packets to the disk. In intrusion detection mode, the program will monitor network traffic and analyze it against a rule set defined by the user. [Snort](https://www.snort.org) will then perform a specific action based on what has been identified.
