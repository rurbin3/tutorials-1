Linux is an extremely popular operating system for hackers. First of all, Linux's source code is freely available because it is an open-source Operating System (OS). This means that Linux is very easy to modify and customize. Second, there are countless Linux security distributions available. Almost all the Ethical Hacking operating systems for security experts are based on a **Linux kernel**.

Keep in mind that, simply having these operating systems does not make anyone a security expert or a hacker. It is extremely important to develop your Linux skills to become an "Ethical Hacker". Nearly all the tools that hackers use are developed for Linux. Linux gives us capabilities that we don't have using Windows.

Starting with reconnaissance, we have included tools such as the Fierce domain scanner and Maltego. For mapping, we have included tools such as WebScarab and ratproxy. We then chose tools for discovery. These would include w3af and burp. For exploitation, the final stage, we included BeEF, AJAXShell and much more. This VM also includes a pre-configured wiki, set up to be the central information store during your pen-test.
