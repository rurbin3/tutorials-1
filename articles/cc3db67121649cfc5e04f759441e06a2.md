[Metasploit](https://metasploit.com) is considered to be one of the most useful auditing tools freely available to security professionals today. The Metasploit Framework provides a truly impressive work environment. Metasploit is far more than just a collection of exploits, it's an infrastructure that you can build upon and utilize for your custom needs. This allows you to concentrate on your unique environment, and not have to reinvent the wheel.

###### HOW TO INSTALL METASPLOIT ON ARCH LINUX ?

The Metasploit Framework is already present in the Arch repository, but without additional preparation, it will not work properly. Metasploit requires Ruby along with PostgreSQL on the target system to work.

**Update the System**

The first thing to do is to update your system to be sure that all packages are installed to the latest version.

```bash
sudo pacman -Syyu
```

**Install Ruby**

When you are ready you can now install the necessary Ruby packages using the below command.

```bash
sudo pacman -S ruby ruby-rdoc
```

**Install RVM**

We will now install and setup RVM on our target system. Before moving further, I highly recommended you to visit the [Metasploit Github Repository](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/blob/master/.ruby-version) to check which version of Ruby is required by the framework. At the time I write this tutorial, Metasploit currently requires the version 2.6.6, but you will need to check it before to proceed.

```bash
gpg --keyserver hkp://pool.sks-keyservers.net --recv-keys 409B6B1796C275462A1703113804BB82D39DC0E3 7D2BAF1CF37B13E2069D6956105BD0E739499BDB
wget -O /tmp/rvm.sh https://get.rvm.io
cd /tmp/
bash rvm.sh stable
echo "source ~/.rvm/scripts/rvm" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.rvm/scripts/rvm
rvm install 2.6.6
rvm use 2.6.6 --default
```

**Install PostgreSQL**

Metasploit can be used without a database, but cache operations like searching would be very slow. This section shows how to set up Metasploit with Postgresql database server. To do it, simply use the below commands.

```bash
sudo pacman -S postgresql --noconfirm --needed
sudo chown -R postgres:postgres /var/lib/postgres/
sudo -Hiu postgres initdb --locale en_US.UTF-8 -E UTF8 -D '/var/lib/postgres/data'
sudo systemctl start postgresql
sudo systemctl enable postgresql
```

**Create PostgreSQL User and Database**

It's now time to create our PostgreSQL user and database. As you can see below, we will create a user named `msf` and a database named also `msf`. You can change it to whatever you want as long you also modify the `database.yml` as described in the below **Clone Metasploit** section. When you are prompted, enter the password you wish to create with your database. I choose to also use `msf` as the password to make everything easier.

```bash
sudo -Hiu postgres createuser msf -P -S -R -D
sudo -Hiu postgres createdb -O msf msf
```

**Clone Metasploit**

We did a lot already ! Next we will clone the Metasploit Framework from [Github](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework) and configure it. As you can see below, we are creating a file called `database.yml`, in which we need to specify our database name, username, and password as created in the previous step.

```bash
cd /opt/
sudo git clone https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework metasploit
cd /opt/metasploit/
gem install wirble sqlite3 bundler
bundle install
sudo touch /opt/metasploit/config/database.yml
echo 'production:' | sudo tee -a /opt/metasploit/config/database.yml
echo ' adapter: postgresql' | sudo tee -a /opt/metasploit/config/database.yml
echo ' database: msf' | sudo tee -a /opt/metasploit/config/database.yml
echo ' username: msf' | sudo tee -a /opt/metasploit/config/database.yml
echo ' password: msf' | sudo tee -a /opt/metasploit/config/database.yml
echo ' host: 127.0.0.1' | sudo tee -a /opt/metasploit/config/database.yml
echo ' port: 5432' | sudo tee -a /opt/metasploit/config/database.yml
echo ' pool: 75' | sudo tee -a /opt/metasploit/config/database.yml
echo ' timeout: 5' | sudo tee -a /opt/metasploit/config/database.yml
sudo sh -c "echo export MSF_DATABASE_CONFIG=/opt/metasploit/config/database.yml >> /etc/profile"
sudo chown -R $USER:users /opt/metasploit
```

**Launch Metasploit Framework**

We are done with the installation of the Metasploit Framework. You can test it immediately using the below command.

```bash
cd /opt/metasploit/
./msfconsole
```

**Output**

**Update Metasploit Framework**

Update your Metasploit Framework packages can be done from a single command directly from the Metasploit directory.

```bash
./msfupdate
```

###### HOW TO INSTALL ARMITAGE ON ARCH LINUX ?

If everything going smoothly you already have Metasploit Framework installed on your target system. We can now move on the easiest and install Armitage. This can be done using the below commands.

```bash
wget -O /tmp/armitage.tgz http://www.fastandeasyhacking.com/download/armitage150813.tgz
cd /tmp/
tar -xvzf /tmp/armitage.tgz
sudo mv /tmp/armitage /opt/
sudo ln -s /opt/armitage/armitage /usr/local/bin/armitage
sudo ln -s /opt/armitage/teamserver /usr/local/bin/teamserver
sh -c "echo java -jar /opt/armitage/armitage.jar \$\* > /opt/armitage/armitage"
sudo perl -pi -e 's/armitage.jar/\/opt\/armitage\/armitage.jar/g' /opt/armitage/teamserver
sudo chown -R $USER:users /opt/armitage
```

**Launch Armitage**

Since we did not install Metasploit Framework using the installer package, before launching Armitage we will need to start manually `msfrpcd` service. To do this, simply run the below command from your terminal.

```bash
cd /opt/metasploit/
./msfrpcd -U msf -P test -f -S -a 127.0.0.1
```

You can now launch Armitage, from your terminal by invoking it.

```bash
armitage
```
