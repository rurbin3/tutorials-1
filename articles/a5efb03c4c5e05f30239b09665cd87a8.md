## Top Password Cracking Techniques used by Hackers

In cryptanalysis and computer security, the term **password cracking** is the process of recovering passwords from data that have been stored in or transmitted by a computer system. A common approach (brute-force attack) is to repeatedly try guesses for the password and to check them against an available cryptographic hash of the password.

In this new era where digital is present in every moment of our daily life, we use a password to protect virtually everything that needs to be protected. We use a password to turn on our computer, to access our email accounts, to login to our bank accounts, to pay our bills and much more.

###### THE VULNERABILITY LIES IN THE COMPLEXITY OF PASSWORD

In general, most people will tend to set passwords that are easy to remember, such as a birthday, a first-name or a last-name, a license plate or a phone number. The problem lies in the fact that most people are not aware of the ease with which a hacker can crack a password.

A strong password must at least match the following requirements:

- Contains at least 8 characters
- A mix of letters, numbers, and special characters
- A combination of small and capital letters

There are two main categories of password cracking techniques:

- **Online** attacks are performed on a live machine or system by using either brute-force or word-list attack against a login form, session, or other types of authentication method used.
- **Offline** attacks are done for example by extracting a stolen website database to retrieve the stored password hashes and attempting to crack them using different techniques.

###### DICTIONARY ATTACK

For such an attack, the hacker uses a predefined list of words mostly stored in a text file and called **dictionary**, to try and guess the password. Most of the password is weak and most the hacker will be enabled to decode it quickly.

When you need to brute force crack a remote authentication service, **Hydra** is often the tool of choice. It can perform rapid dictionary attacks against more than 50 protocols, including telnet, ftp, http, https, smb, several databases, and much more. Before to move further, if Hydra is not yet installed on your machine, you can do it right away using one of the below installation methods. For more information about Hydra, you can visit the [THC Hydra](https://github.com/vanhauser-thc/thc-hydra) project page.

**Ubuntu/Debian and other derived distributions**

```bash
sudo apt -y update
sudo apt -y install libssl-dev libssh-dev libidn11-dev libpcre3-dev libgtk2.0-dev libmysqlclient-dev libpq-dev libsvn-dev firebird-dev
sudo apt -y install hydra hydra-gtk
```

You can alternatively build **Hydra** directly from the source code

```bash
cd /tmp/
git clone https://github.com/vanhauser-thc/thc-hydra
cd thc-hydra/
./configure
make
make install
```

**Usage**

For attacking one target or a network, you can use the new "://" style: hydra [some command-line options] PROTOCOL://TARGET:PORT/MODULE-OPTIONS The old mode can be used for these too, and additionally if you want to specify your targets from a text file, you must use this one:

```bash
hydra [some command-line options] [-s PORT] TARGET PROTOCOL [MODULE-OPTIONS]
```

Via the command line options, you specify which logins to try, which passwords, if SSL should be used, how many parallel tasks to use for attacking, etc.

For this article, we will use **Hydra** to gain access to PHPMyAdmin onto a remote server. If you need some good dictionaries list, I recommend those made available by [SkullSecurity](https://wiki.skullsecurity.org/Passwords) and by [Daniel Miessler](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/) that you can download freely.

To try to gain access to PHPMyAdmin we will run the following command.

```bash
hydra -t 1 -L users.list -P passwords.list -f -vV 3.11.107.102 http-post-form "/phpmyadmin/index.php:pma_username=^USER^&pma_password=^PASS^&server=1:denied"
```

Before to see the output of the above command, let have a look at every parameter.

- **-t** it's used to configure the number of parallel connection
- **-L** define the path of the file containing the logins
- **-P** define the path of the file containing the passwords
- **-f** to force the program to exit if a login/pass pair is found
- **-vV** to execute the command in verbose∕debug mode
- **3.11.107.102** the IP address of our pentest lab
- **http-post-form** the path of the form that our tool will try to gain access

**Output**

As you can see on the above screenshot, after a few attempts, **Hydra** did found the correct combination of username and password allowing us to gain access to PHPMyAdmin.

###### HYBRID DICTIONARY ATTACK

**Hybrid Dictionary** attack uses a set of dictionary words combined with extensions. For example, we have the word "admin" and combine it with number extensions such as "admin123", "admin147", etc...

"Crunch" is a wordlist generator where you can specify a standard character set or a character set. Crunch can generate all possible combinations and permutations. This tool comes bundled with **Kali Linux**. If you do not have **Crunch** yet installed in your machine, you can do it, following the below instructions.

**Crunch Features**

- Crunch generates wordlists in both combination and permutation ways
- It can breakup output by the number of lines or file size
- Pattern supports number and symbols
- Pattern supports upper and lower case characters separately
- Adds a status report when generating multiple files
- New -l option for literal support of @,%^
- New -d option to limit duplicate characters see man file for details

**Install Crunch on Ubuntu/Debian and other derived distributions**

```bash
sudo apt -f install crunch
```

**Install Crunch on Red Hat based distributions**

```bash
sudo yum install crunch
```

**Install Crunch on OpenSUSE based distributions**

```bash
sudo zypper install crunch
```

The Crunch docs are bundled in a crunch-doc package that should be installed separately.

```bash
sudo apt-get install crunch-doc
```

If you want to find out more about **Crunch**, I suggest you visit the [Sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/crunch-wordlist/) page of the project.

**HOW TO USE CRUNCH**

**Create a word list without using any predefined string**

Execute the command shown below, will generate a dictionary that contains a minimum of 2 characters and a maximum of 3, using default characters. It will start from **aa** and end with **zzz**.

```bash
crunch 2 3 -o test.txt
```

Here we have used the following parameters to generate our dictionary:

- Min_len: 2, for two character letters
- Max_len: 3, for three-character letters
* -o: This option indicates the path where to save the output of the text file

**Create a word list without using a predefined string**

Now run the command shown below to generate a dictionary that contains a minimum of 4 characters and a maximum of 5, using **noob** as a predefined string. As per the previous example, the dictionary will start from **nnnn** and end with *bbbbb**.

```bash
crunch 4 5 noob -o test.txt
```

**Create alphanumeric word list with crunch**

If we need to create an alphanumeric dictionary we can do it using the following command.

```bash
crunch 2 5 noob123 -o test.txt
```

Execute the above command that will generate a dictionary that contains a minimum of 2 character letters and a maximum of 5 using **noob123** as the predefined string.

Once you are done with your dictionary, you can go back to the previous paragraph and use a tool such as **Hydra** to gain access to your target.

###### BRUTE-FORCE ATTACK

Brute-Force attacks work by calculating every possible combination that could make up a password and testing it to see if it is the correct password. As the password's length increases, the amount of time, on average, to find the correct password increases exponentially.

This type of attack has a high probability of success, but it requires an enormous amount of time to process all the combinations. **John the Ripper** is one of the powerful tools to set a brute-force attack and it comes bundled with **Kali Linux** and **ParrotSec**. If you do not have it yet installed in your machine, you can do it, following the below instructions.

**Install John the Ripper on Ubuntu/Debian and other derived distributions**

```bash
sudo apt -f install john
```

**Install John the Ripper on Red Hat based distributions**

```bash
sudo yum install john
```

**Install John the Ripper on OpenSUSE based distributions**

```bash
sudo zypper install john
```

**HOW TO USE JOHN THE RIPPER**

Before starting with password cracking we can launch a simple performance hardware test. In this way, we can know the speed with which the tool will test keys with different types of encryption using 100% of our CPU.

```bash
john --test
```

**Output**

![image-2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neoslab/tutorials/master/medias/a5efb03c4c5e05f30239b09665cd87a8-2.png "Image-2")

As we can see, a series of tests are carried out for the performance to be measured.

**CRACK LINUX USER PASSWORDS WITHOUT DICTIONARY**

We will now move on to a real case. We can choose to directly load the file "`/etc/shadow`" that contains the Linux passwords and crack them, however, in this example we will create a file manually with a user and a password and we will tell **John** to crack it. We will do this for three reasons:

- To not compromise our system
- To get the results as quickly as possible
- To have a first contact with the tool and familiarize ourselves with it

For this, we create a new text file named "password.txt", in our "`/tmp/`" folder with the following content:

```bash
user:AZl.zWwxIh15Q
```

Once we are done, we will run the following command:

```bash
cd /tmp/
john password.txt
```

**Output**

![image-3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neoslab/tutorials/master/medias/a5efb03c4c5e05f30239b09665cd87a8-3.png "Image-3")

Our password has been cracked. To see it, we must use the "`--show`" parameter as per the following command:

```bash
john --show password.txt
```

![image-4](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neoslab/tutorials/master/medias/a5efb03c4c5e05f30239b09665cd87a8-4.png "Image-4")

Our password was "example" as in the [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_the_Ripper) sample. We can now try to log in to the system with the user "user" and the password "example", or it's what we would be able to do if we had worked directly with the file "`/etc/shadow`", although the cracking time would have taken much more than several minutes

**CRACK LINUX USER PASSWORDS WITH DICTIONARY**

We will repeat the same steps as before except that this time we will insert in our command the path to a dictionary that contains all the passwords to try.

```bash
john --wordlist=dictionary.lst shadow
john --show shadow
```

**Output**

![image-5](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neoslab/tutorials/master/medias/a5efb03c4c5e05f30239b09665cd87a8-5.png "Image-5")

Having a simple password and few dictionary entries the process will be virtually instantaneous. We have already cracked or decrypted, the password.

###### RAINBOW TABLES

A rainbow table contains a set of predefined passwords that are hashed. It is a lookup table used especially in recovering plain passwords from a ciphertext. During the process of password recovery, it just looks at the pre-calculated hash table to crack the password. The tables can be downloaded from [Rainbowcrack](http://project-rainbowcrack.com/table.htm) project page.

###### QUICK TIPS

- Don’t note down the passwords anywhere, just memorize them.
- Set strong passwords that are difficult to crack.
- Use a combination of alphabets, digits, symbols, and capital and small letters.
- Don’t set passwords that are similar to their usernames.
