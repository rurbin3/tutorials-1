## The Most Useful Nmap Commands from Beginner to Advanced

![thumbnail](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neoslab/tutorials/master/thumbnails/9b85c5f874a849eea2846845786fa4f6-1920x1080.jpg "Thumbnail")

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is an open-source tool for network exploration and security auditing. It was designed to rapidly scan large networks, although it works fine against single hosts. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what hosts are available on the network, what services (application name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems (and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics.

While Nmap is commonly used for security audits, many systems and network administrators find it useful for routine tasks such as network inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or service uptime.

The output from Nmap is a list of scanned targets, with supplemental information on each depending on the options used. Key among that information is the "interesting ports table". That table lists the port number and protocol, service name, and state. The state is either open, filtered, closed, or unfiltered.

Open means that an application on the target machine is listening for connections/packets on that port. Filtered. means that a firewall, filter, or other network obstacle is blocking the port so that Nmap cannot tell whether it is open or closed. Closed. ports have no application listening on them, though they could open up at any time. Ports are classified as unfiltered. when they are responsive to Nmap's probes, but Nmap cannot determine whether they are open or closed.

Nmap reports the state combinations open|filtered. and closed|filtered. when it cannot determine which of the two states describe a port. The port table may also include software version details when version detection has been requested. When an IP protocol scan is requested (-sO), Nmap provides information on supported IP protocols rather than listening ports.

In addition to the interesting ports table, Nmap can provide further information on targets, including reverse DNS names, operating system guesses, device types, and MAC addresses.

###### THE NMAP KEYS FEATURES

- Flexible: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and other obstacles. This includes many port scanning mechanisms (both TCP & UDP), OS detection, version detection, ping sweeps, and more. See the documentation page.
- Powerful: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of literally hundreds of thousands of machines.
- Portable: Most operating systems are supported, including Linux, Microsoft Windows, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, Solaris, IRIX, Mac OS X, HP-UX, NetBSD, Sun OS, Amiga, and more.
- Easy: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for power users, you can start as simply as "nmap -v -A targethost". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI) versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from the source.
- Free: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make the Internet a little more secure and to provide administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring their networks. Nmap is available for free download, and also comes with full source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of the license.
- Well Documented: Significant effort has been put into comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and even a whole book!
- Supported: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the Nmap mailing lists. Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the nmap-dev list, but only after you read the guidelines. We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic nmap-hackers announcement list. You can also find Nmap on Facebook and Twitter. For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on Freenode or EFNet.
- Acclaimed: Nmap has won numerous awards, including "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book series.
- Popular: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of 30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.

###### FEATURES

**Nmap features include**

- Host discovery – Identifying hosts on a network. For example, listing the hosts that respond to TCP and/or ICMP requests or have a particular port open.
- Port scanning – Enumerating the open ports on target hosts.
- Version detection – Interrogating network services on remote devices to determine the application name and version number.
- OS detection – Determining the operating system and hardware characteristics of network devices.
- Scriptable interaction with the target – using Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE) and Lua programming language.

Nmap can provide further information on targets, including reverse DNS names, device types, and MAC addresses.

**Typical uses of Nmap**

- Auditing the security of a device or firewall by identifying the network connections which can be made to, or through it.
- Identifying open ports on a target host in preparation for auditing
- Network inventory, network mapping, maintenance, and asset management.
- Auditing the security of a network by identifying new servers.
- Generating traffic to hosts on a network, response analysis and response time measurement.
- Finding and exploiting vulnerabilities in a network.

###### SCAN A SINGLE HOST OR AN IP ADDRESS

```bash
# Scan a single ip address
nmap 192.168.1.1
# Scan a host name
nmap server1.neoslab.com
# Scan a hostname with more info
nmap -v server1.neoslab.com
```

* * *

###### SCAN MULTIPLE IP ADDRESS OR SUBNET

```bash
nmap 192.168.1.1 192.168.1.2 192.168.1.3
# Works with same subnet i.e. 192.168.1.0/24
nmap 192.168.1.1,2,3
```

You can scan a range of IP address too:

```bash
nmap 192.168.1.1-20
```

You can scan a range of IP address using a wildcard:

```bash
nmap 192.168.1.*
```

Finally, you scan an entire subnet:

```bash
nmap 192.168.1.0/24
```

* * *

###### READ LIST OF HOSTS/NETWORKS FROM FILE

The "`-iL`" option allows you to read the list of target systems using a text file. This is useful to scan a large number of hosts/networks. Create a text file as follows:

```bash
cat > /tmp/test.txt
```

**Output**

```none
server1.neoslab.com
192.168.1.0/24
192.168.1.1/24
10.1.2.3
localhost
```

**Syntax**

```bash
nmap -iL /tmp/test.txt
```

* * *

###### EXCLUDING HOSTS/NETWORKS

When scanning a large number of hosts/networks you can exclude hosts from a scan:

```bash
nmap 192.168.1.0/24 --exclude 192.168.1.5
nmap 192.168.1.0/24 --exclude 192.168.1.5,192.168.1.254
```

OR exclude list from a file called /tmp/exclude.txt

```bash
nmap -iL /tmp/scanlist.txt --excludefile /tmp/exclude.txt
```

* * *

###### TURN ON OS AND VERSION DETECTION SCANNING SCRIPT

```bash
nmap -A 192.168.1.254
nmap -v -A 192.168.1.1
nmap -A -iL /tmp/scanlist.txt

```

* * *

###### FIND OUT IF A HOST/NETWORK IS PROTECTED BY A FIREWALL

```bash
nmap -sA 192.168.1.254
nmap -sA server1.neoslab.com
```

* * *

###### SCAN A HOST WHEN PROTECTED BY THE FIREWALL

```bash
nmap -PN 192.168.1.1
nmap -PN server1.neoslab.com
```

* * *

###### SCAN AN IPV6 HOST/ADDRESS

The "`-6`" option enable IPv6 scanning. The syntax is:

```bash
nmap -6 server1.neoslab.com
nmap -6 2607:f0d0:1002:51::4
nmap -v A -6 2607:f0d0:1002:51::4
```

* * *

###### SCAN A NETWORK AND FIND OUT WHICH SERVERS AND DEVICES ARE UP AND RUNNING

This is known as host discovery or ping scan:

```bash
nmap -sP 192.168.1.0/24
```

**Output**

```none
Host 192.168.1.1 is up (0.00035s latency).
MAC Address: BC:AE:C5:C3:16:93 (Unknown)
Host 192.168.1.2 is up (0.0038s latency).

Nmap done: 256 IP addresses (4 hosts up) scanned in 2.80 second
```

* * *

###### HOW DO I PERFORM A FAST SCAN?

```bash
nmap -F 192.168.1.1
```

* * *

###### DISPLAY THE REASON A PORT IS IN A PARTICULAR STATE

```bash
nmap --reason 192.168.1.1
nmap --reason server1.neoslab.com
```

* * *

###### ONLY SHOW OPEN (OR POSSIBLY OPEN) PORTS

```bash
nmap --open 192.168.1.1
nmap --open server1.neoslab.com

```

```bash
nmap --packet-trace 192.168.1.1
nmap --packet-trace server1.neoslab.com
```

* * *

###### SHOW HOST INTERFACES AND ROUTES

This is useful for debugging (IP command or route command or "`netstat`" command like output using nmap)

```bash
nmap -F 192.168.1.1
```

###### SCAN A HOST USING TCP ACK (PA) AND TCP SYN (PS) PING

If a firewall is blocking standard ICMP pings, try the following host discovery methods:

```bash
nmap -PS 192.168.1.1
nmap -PS 80,21,443 192.168.1.1
nmap -PA 192.168.1.1
nmap -PA 80,21,200-512 192.168.1.1
```

* * *

###### SCAN A HOST USING IP PROTOCOL PING

```bash
nmap -PO 192.168.1.1

```

* * *

###### SCAN A HOST USING UDP PING

This scan bypasses firewalls and filters that only screen TCP:

```bash
nmap -PU 192.168.1.1
nmap -PU 2000.2001 192.168.1.1
```

* * *

###### FIND OUT THE MOST COMMONLY USED TCP PORTS USING TCP SYN SCAN

```bash
# Stealthy scan
nmap -sS 192.168.1.1
# Find out the most commonly used TCP ports using  TCP connect scan (warning: no stealth scan)
# OS Fingerprinting
nmap -sT 192.168.1.1
# Find out the most commonly used TCP ports using TCP ACK scan
nmap -sA 192.168.1.1
# Find out the most commonly used TCP ports using TCP Window scan
nmap -sW 192.168.1.1
# Find out the most commonly used TCP ports using TCP Maimon scan
nmap -sM 192.168.1.1
```

* * *

###### SCAN A HOST FOR UDP SERVICES (UDP SCAN)

Most popular services on the Internet run over the TCP protocol. DNS, SNMP, and DHCP are three of the most common UDP services. Use the following syntax to find out UDP services:

```bash
nmap -sU nas03
nmap -sU 192.168.1.1
```

**Output**

* * *

###### SCAN FOR IP PROTOCOL

This type of scan allows you to determine which IP protocols (TCP, ICMP, IGMP, etc.) are supported by target machines:

```bash
nmap -sO 192.168.1.1
```

* * *

###### SCAN A FIREWALL FOR SECURITY WEAKNESS

The following scan types exploit a subtle loophole in the TCP and good for testing security of common attacks:

```bash
# TCP Null Scan to fool a firewall to generate a response
# Does not set any bits (TCP flag header is 0)
nmap -sN 192.168.1.254
# TCP Fin scan to check the firewall
# Sets just the TCP FIN bit
nmap -sF 192.168.1.254
# TCP Xmas scan to check the firewall
# Sets the FIN, PSH, and URG flags, lighting the packet up like a Christmas tree
nmap -sX 192.168.1.254
```

* * *

###### SCAN A FIREWALL FOR PACKETS FRAGMENTS

The "`-f`" option causes the requested scan (including ping scans) to use tiny fragmented IP packets. The idea is to split up the TCP header over several packets to make it harder for packet filters, intrusion detection systems, and other annoyances to detect what you are doing.

```bash
nmap -f 192.168.1.1
nmap -f fw2.nixcraft.net.in
nmap -f 15 fw2.nixcraft.net.in
# Set your offset size with the --mtu option
nmap --mtu 32 192.168.1.1
```

* * *

###### CLOAK A SCAN WITH DECOYS

The "`-D`" option it appears to the remote host that the host(s) you specify as **decoys are scanning the target network too.** Thus their IDS might report 5-10 port scans from unique IP addresses, but they won’t know which IP was scanning them and which were innocent decoys:

```bash
nmap -n -Ddecoy-ip1,decoy-ip2,your-own-ip,decoy-ip3,decoy-ip4 remote-host-ip
nmap -n -D192.168.1.5,10.5.1.2,172.1.2.4,3.4.2.1 192.168.1.5
```

* * *

###### SCAN A FIREWALL FOR MAC ADDRESS SPOOFING

```bash
# Spoof your MAC address
nmap --spoof-mac MAC-ADDRESS-HERE 192.168.1.1
# Add other options
nmap -v -sT -PN --spoof-mac MAC-ADDRESS-HERE 192.168.1.1
# Use a random MAC address
# The number 0, means nmap chooses a completely random MAC address
nmap -v -sT -PN --spoof-mac 0 192.168.1.1
```

* * *

###### HOW DO I SAVE OUTPUT TO A TEXT FILE?

**Syntax**

```bash
nmap 192.168.1.1 > output.txt
nmap -oN /path/to/filename 192.168.1.1
nmap -oN output.txt 192.168.1.1
```

* * *

###### SCANS FOR WEB SERVERS AND PIPES INTO NIKTO FOR SCANNING

```bash
nmap -p80 192.168.1.2/24 -oG - | /path/to/nikto.pl -h -
nmap -p80,443 192.168.1.2/24 -oG - | /path/to/nikto.pl -h -
```

* * *

###### SPEED UP NMAP

Pass the "`-T`" option:

```bash
nmap -v -sS -A -T4 192.168.2.5
```
