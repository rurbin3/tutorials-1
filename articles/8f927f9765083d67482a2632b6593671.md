**Venom** uses **Msfvenom** from **Metasploit** to generate shellcode in different formats such as "c", "python", "ruby", "dll", "msi", "hta-psh" to inject the shellcode generated into one template and work with encrypted payloads.

The python function will execute the shellcode into ram and uses compilers like **gcc** or **mingw32** or **pyinstaller** to build the executable file, and will start a Metasploit multi-handler session to receive the remote connection.

The next screen will show you the information about the Option Built, the target machine, the payload format, and the and output. There is 7 different type of option builds shellcode listed. We are going to use the shellcode "**number 4**" for this demonstration.

###### PAYLOAD CONFIGURATION

You will need now to choose your agent referral. For this payload, Venom offers you two options. Select the one that you want to use between **Android** and **IOS**. On our side, we will select the agent "**number 1**" for this demonstration.

We will need now to set up the localhost IP address along with the local port. Now enter your local machine IP address and local port which will be used by the payload for listening. For your information local IP address and local port are always referred to as "**LHOST**" and "**LPORT**" exactly like Metasploit.

It's now the time to give a name to our payload which will be used to save it and to define the way we want the payload to be delivered.

###### LAUNCH THE ATTACK

At this stage, we can say that you are almost done! A new terminal will automatically start a session of Metasploit allowing you to conduct your attack with the encrypted Payload.
